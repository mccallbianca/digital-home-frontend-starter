# Digital Home Starter

## First Time Setup

If you just cloned this repo, follow these steps in order. You need both this repo (Frontend) and the [Digital Home Backend](https://github.com/lukesbrave/digital-home-backend) repo.

### Step 1: Create a Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free project
2. Save these values from Settings > API:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abcdefg.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
   - **service_role secret key** (starts with `eyJ...` — keep this secret)

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run each migration file from `supabase/migrations/` in order (001 through 010)
3. Then run the Backend tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS brand_context (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS backend_settings (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  value JSONB NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE brand_context ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access" ON brand_context FOR ALL USING (true);

ALTER TABLE backend_settings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access" ON backend_settings FOR ALL USING (true);
```

### Step 3: Create an Admin User
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication > Users > Add user**
2. Set an email and password — this is your login for the Backend dashboard
3. There is no public signup. All admin users are created here.

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```
Fill in your Supabase URL, anon key, service role key, and site name. See the "Environment Variables" section below for the full list.

### Step 5: Set Up Your Content Corpus
```bash
cp -r content-corpus-examples/ content-corpus/
```
Edit each file in `content-corpus/` with your brand's voice, positioning, offers, testimonials, and keywords. **This is the most important step** — it's what makes the AI write like you instead of generic slop.

### Step 6: Install and Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 7: Customize Your Pages
Every page has placeholder content marked with `[YOUR BRAND]`, `[Your Headline]`, etc. Open each page in `src/app/` and replace the placeholders with your actual content. Claude Code can help — say "help me customize the homepage."

### Step 8: Deploy to Cloudflare
```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy
```
Then set server-side secrets via `wrangler secret put` (see Environment Variables section below).

### Step 9: Set Up the Backend
Clone and set up the [Digital Home Backend](https://github.com/lukesbrave/digital-home-backend) repo — follow its CLAUDE.md for instructions. The Backend manages your content pipeline, and both repos share the same Supabase database.

### Need Help?
The Digital Home is built and maintained by BraveBrand. If you want help with:
- The brand intelligence process (content corpus, voice guide, positioning)
- The AI writing skills and content strategy workflow
- Design guidance and implementation support
- A community of founders building their own Digital Homes

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js 15 website starter deployed on Cloudflare Workers with Supabase as the data layer. The site is designed to speak to three audiences simultaneously: human visitors (personalized UX), AI agents (REST API), and search engines/LLMs (structured data + llms.txt).

**This is the Frontend** — the client-facing public website. Behind it sits the **Digital Home Backend** (separate repo), which is the backend operating system — content pipeline, lead management, email sequences, analytics, and agent oversight. Both share the same Supabase database.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript, RSC by default)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (OpenNext)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) — schema in `/supabase/migrations/`
- **Email:** Resend
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (admin dashboard only)

```

## Environment Variables

### Build-time public variables
These go in the Cloudflare dashboard AND in `wrangler.jsonc` under `vars`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL      — Supabase project URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY — Supabase anon key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL          — Your live site URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME         — Your brand name
SUPABASE_URL                  — Runtime duplicate for server-side access
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY             — Runtime duplicate for server-side access
```

### Server-side secrets
Set via `wrangler secret put` from the terminal:
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY     — Service role key, bypasses RLS
API_SECRET_KEY                — Shared secret between Frontend and Backend (must match both)
RESEND_API_KEY                — Resend email API key
```

## Cloudflare / OpenNext Rules

This project runs on Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (OpenNext). These rules prevent build and runtime failures:

### NEVER add edge runtime exports
Do **not** add `export const runtime = 'edge'` to any route file. OpenNext handles runtime assignment itself and rejects manual edge runtime exports.

### NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars don't exist at runtime on Workers
Cloudflare Workers can only read `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables at build time (baked into the JS bundle). At runtime on the server, they're `undefined`. This is why:
- `wrangler.jsonc` has both `SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` uses the fallback pattern: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || process.env.SUPABASE_URL`
- When creating new server-side code that reads env vars, always use this fallback pattern

### Secrets must be set via Wrangler CLI
Server-side secrets must be set using `wrangler secret put`. The Cloudflare dashboard UI only works for Pages projects, not Workers.

### Always run `npm run build` before pushing
`next dev` does not catch all TypeScript errors. `next build` does.

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Cloudflare, not Vercel** — zero egress fees, predictable pricing
- **Native email (Resend), not a third-party platform** — unified data, agent-managed, no platform lock-in
- **Content as structured objects** — every piece of content is a row in `content_objects` with metadata, semantic tags, associated offers, and performance data
- **Personalization via rules engine** — JSON rules stored in `personalization_rules` table, evaluated per visitor on each page load
- **Knowledge graph in the database** — `entities` and `entity_relationships` tables, JSON-LD generated dynamically
- **Schema markup on every page** — dynamically generated from `entities` table, never hardcoded

## Important Conventions
- **Server Components by default.** Only use `'use client'` when interactivity requires it.
- All API routes support API key auth for agents AND session auth for admin dashboard.
- Every page should include dynamic JSON-LD from the `entities` table.
- Visitor tracking is anonymous until opt-in. No PII before email capture.
- **CRITICAL — Shared database types:** When you modify `src/types/database.ts`, you MUST also update the same file in the Backend project. These two files must always be identical.

## Customization Guide

### Pages to customize (in order of importance)
1. **`src/app/page.tsx`** — Homepage: headline, description, services preview, CTA
2. **`src/app/about/page.tsx`** — Your story, beliefs, team members
3. **`src/app/services/page.tsx`** — Your service offerings
4. **`src/app/contact/page.tsx`** — Contact methods and email
5. **`src/app/layout.tsx`** — Site title and metadata
6. **`src/components/layout/NavBar.tsx`** — Your logo/brand name

### Design customization
- **Colors:** Edit CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css` (the `:root` block)
- **Fonts:** Replace the Google Fonts imports in `src/app/layout.tsx` or add your own @font-face
- **Logo:** Replace `[YOUR BRAND]` text in NavBar.tsx with an `<img>` tag pointing to your logo in `/public/`

### Content that auto-populates from the database
- Blog articles (written by the Backend's AI content pipeline)
- JSON-LD schema (from the `entities` table)
- llms.txt (from entities, content, and offers)
- Sitemap (from published content)
